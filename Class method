Because @@users is a class variable, 
we'll use a class method to grab it. 
Most of the methods you've seen so far are instance methodsâ€”they work on a particular instance/object, such as "matz" or "blixy". 
A class method belongs to the class itself, and for that reason, it's prefixed with the class name.

class Machine
  def Machine.hello
    puts "Hello from the machine!"
  end
end
